# RTS Controls - Right Click to Move
RTS (Real-Time Strategy) Controls - Right Click to Move is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop (Foundry VTT) that enhances the user experience by enabling intuitive and real-time token movement controls. Inspired by classic RTS games, this module allows users to direct their tokens across the game map efficiently and interactively. With a simple right-click, players can plot a course for their tokens, bringing a dynamic and strategic layer to their game sessions.

### Features
Intuitive Control: Streamline token movements with a simple right-click interface, mimicking the familiar controls of traditional RTS games.

Pathfinding: Leverage advanced pathfinding algorithms to navigate through complex maps, ensuring tokens find the most efficient route to their destination.

Collision Avoidance: Smartly handle token interactions by detecting potential collisions and intelligently resolving conflicts to maintain smooth gameplay.

Grid Space Management: Efficiently manage grid space with a system that tracks token positions, reservations, and movements, ensuring order and precision on the battlefield.

Visual Feedback: Enhance spatial awareness with visual cues, including path lines and destination markers, providing clear and immediate feedback on token movement plans.

Movement Animation: Bring tokens to life with smooth animations that reflect real-time movement decisions, adding a layer of immersion to the gameplay.

Pause and Resume: Seamlessly integrate with Foundry VTT's game controls, allowing users to pause and resume token movements in sync with the game's flow.

Conflict Resolution: Implement a fair and random conflict resolution mechanism to decide the movement priority when multiple tokens vie for the same space.

Customizable Settings: Tailor the movement experience to your game's needs with adjustable settings for movement speed, collision handling, and visual effects.

Support for Multiple Tokens: Efficiently handle movements for multiple tokens simultaneously, enabling complex maneuvers and coordinated actions.

### Controls
